{"name":"Cssspinning","tagline":"Spin anything with Css","body":"Css spinning\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis tech is used for an iphone app listed on appstore. Screen shot is here \r\n![src1](http://i1363.photobucket.com/albums/r708/MyteeNathanwit/sr1_zps0d5396ac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#How it works\r\nThe whole idea is using @-webkit-keyframes. We give it a name and set the rotation \"from\" to \"to\" like this.\r\n\r\n`@-webkit-keyframes rotatingleft {\r\n    from{\r\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);    \r\n    }\r\n    to{\r\n    -webkit-transform: rotate(-360deg);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nThen we set a class to call this keyframe like this\r\n\r\n`.spinning_left{\r\n    -webkit-animation: rotatingleft 2s linear infinite;\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is all. From now, any element given this class will spin. Since we set it infinitive, it will keep spinning. \r\nYou can set it on hover, so when the element got focus, it will spin, and stop otherwise.\r\n\r\n#note\r\n\r\n-On iphone, hover works as light tap, so u can make a button spin when u touch it, and do something else when you tap it.\r\n\r\nJust have a play with the source code, having fun with the numbers, change them, make them big number, or small one to see the effect. That how I did.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
